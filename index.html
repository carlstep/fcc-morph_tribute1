                            <em>Morph</em> was created in 1977 for the BBC by
                            Aardman Animations.

                        <em>Morph</em> appeared mainly in one-minute
                        "shorts" interspersed throughout the
                        <em>Tony Hart </em> show.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        These were connected to the main show by having Hart
                        deliver a line or two to <em>Morph</em> who would reply
                        in gobbledygook but with meaningful gestures.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Later on, <em>Morph</em> was joined by cream-coloured
                        <em>Chas</em>, who was much more badly behaved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <em>Morph</em> can change shape, he would become spheres
                        in order to move around, or extrude into cylinders to
                        pass to different levels. He can also mimic other
                        objects, or creatures. <em>Morph</em> lives in a wooden
                        microscope box on an artists desk, and he and
                        <em>Chas</em> both loved to eat cake, as seen in many of
                        the shorts.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Morph's 30th birthday was celebrated in 2007 by creator
                        <em>Peter Lord</em>.

                            reappeared in a 2018 short in a silent role more
                            akin to Luxo Jr.
